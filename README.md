# COVID App - Group assignment 

This is the place where we will manage our project.. The idea of this application or website is to provide the residents of Australia with some positive support throughout the COVID crisis. 

## Application Features 

The application utilises two different API services, one if Microsofts Text Analysis service wich analyses our posts for positivity sentiment, we only allow 50% and above positive sentiment to be displayed on the page. For the other API service we tapped into is a Tasty food API which provides users with random comfort food recipies to make during lockdown.

The tech stack is as follows: 
- Ruby on Rails (Active Record)
- Sinatra 
- JavaScript 
- HTML/CSS
